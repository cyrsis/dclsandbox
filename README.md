# dclsandbox

# Goal
Experince with the SDK to try out different thing can build in here



# Basic Command

`dcl init`

`dcl run`

`dcl preview`

`dcl deploy`

# Idea behind the DCL

 - React like (but do not have react)
 - Docker Build with high speed rendering
 - Rendering is solid
 - Likely to Reach max rending limit
 - Animation is pretty smooth
 - TypeScript
 - Take Ploy 3 Model
 - Take Blender
 
# Tools needed
   
 - Blender
 - Substance
 - Intellij
 - ganache(local blockchain)
 - metamask
  
# logs
